# Coming soon - Things you need to know before divvyl launches

### What is divvyr?
divvyr is a social media app focusing on connecting with new people, and is currently locked to replit users (this may change in the future). We want to make the community our top priority, which is why descisions are made by our community! All reports are also dealt with by an automatic poll system for the community.

### Who is it for?
Anyone really! Currently, we're focusing on the dev community as they help divvyr a lot by checking for vulnerabilities.

### What's the idea behind it?
The idea is to have a friendly place to meet new people, which used to be Twitter, until it got super toxic, and now we need a new alternative that doesn't suck, and cares about it's community, without the toxicity. We want most of repler to be run by the community, and not just some robots that just guess what to moderate.

### When is it coming? 
Currently it's still being developed, and is limited for use of only the developers, and most important features are currently not working, but you can expect a release in ~2 months time from now.
